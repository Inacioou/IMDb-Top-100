# IMDb Top 100 Analysis

## Description: 
This project aims to analyze the IMDb Top 100 Movies list. The analysis will include various aspects such as movie ratings, release year, genre, and box office performance. The project uses Python and its data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Currently, the repository includes a Jupyter notebook containing the initial data collection and cleaning processes, along with the exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the top 100 movies. The EDA includes visualizations that provide insights into the distribution of ratings, genres, and release years among the top movies.

Future updates for this project will include deeper analysis and modeling of the data. This will involve using machine learning techniques to predict the rating of a movie based on its features, such as the genre, release year, and box office performance. Additionally, the project will look at the correlation between a movie's success and factors such as its gross total income and critical reception.

Overall, this project serves as an exciting opportunity to explore the data behind some of the greatest movies of all time and gain insights into what makes them so popular. The ongoing updates and enhancements to the project will provide continued value and a wealth of knowledge for anyone interested in movies, data analysis, and machine learning.
